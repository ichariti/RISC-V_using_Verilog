# RISCV-using-Verilog
This project uses the Hardware Description Language Verilog, with the end goal of creating a basic, simplified version of a RISC-V processor.
It consists of 5 parts:
1) Create an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
2) Create a calculator that utilizes this ALU
3) Create a register file
4) Create a high level diagram of RISC-V
5) Create a multi-cycle control unit for the RISC-V processor
